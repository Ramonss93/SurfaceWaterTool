   [:p
    "In simple terms, the tool works by first merging data from different"
    " landsat satellite missions to one big stack of images for the selected"
    " period. From this stack of images two percentiles are calculated for"
    " each pixel, one rather low percentile (default 8%) and one higher"
    " percentile (40%). Here, a percentile is a measure indicating the value"
    " below which a given percentage of pixels in a group of pixels falls. For"
    " these two percentile maps the Normalized Difference Water Index (NDWI)"
    " is calculated. This index combines several spectral bands that are"
    " sensitive the the occurrence of water. For each percentile map a threshold"
    " value is applied classifying pixels as water or non-water. The resulting"
    " maps give an indication of the number of times a given pixel was classified"
    " as water vs. non water over the selected period (but not an exact value)."
    " So for the 8% map the pixels are covered with water much less than the 40%"
    " maps and these are indicated as temporary and permanent water respectively."
    " Due to the statistical nature of this method the maps are asynchronous in"
    " time, i.e. not each pixel is covered with water at the same time but these"
    " maps are an integration over the selected period. In further steps, the"
    " water detection is refined by checking for areas that are unlikely to have"
    " surface water and filter out dark vegetation wrongly detected as water."]
